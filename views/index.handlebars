    <p>Funny Guy is the ultimate test of comedic superiority! Team up with
        three friends and host a game to start. You can name your game whatever you want  
        so be creative! Share your game title with your friends and start the game after 
        everyone has joined.
        <br>
        <br>
        After everyone is in, it's time to be funny! Everyone will be paired
        up and asked to provide funny answers to funny questions, then you'll
        cycle through the questions and vote for your favorite answers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whoever has the most votes by the end of the game is officially a funny guy!
        If you're the winner, feel free to rub it in all of your friend's faces for eternity. 
        Also remember that anything goes and have fun!
